# Cross Note

Cross Note represents a .NET MAUI sample app showcasing a robust text editor feature, a component currently absent in MAUI's native capabilities. DotNET MAUI stands as a powerful framework for crafting cross-platform applications using your preferred DotNET library. While the framework continues to evolve, a notable gap existed in the form of a native rich text editor. To address this, I leveraged [Quill.JS](https://quilljs.com/) to integrate this essential feature into MAUI. I trust that exploring this repository will prove engaging and enlightening.

In place of Quill.JS, one can use TinyMCE, and CKEditor to add some more advanced editor features.
